                "<h2>What is Kotlin?</h2>\nKotlin is an open-source statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript and Native. Itâ€™s developed by JetBrains. The project started in 2010 and was open source from very early on. The first official 1.0 release was in February 2016.<br><br><h3>What is the current version of Kotlin?</h3>\nThe currently released version is 1.5.31, published on September 20, 2021. <br><br><h3>Overview</h3>\nKotlin can be used for any kind of development, be it server-side, client-side web and Android. With Kotlin/Native currently in the works, support for other platforms such as embedded systems, macOS and iOS is coming. People are using Kotlin for mobile and server-side applications, client-side with JavaScript or JavaFX, and data science, just to name a few possibilities. <br><br><h3>What IDEs support Kotlin?</h3>\nKotlin is supported by all major Java IDEs including IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, and Eclipse. In addition, a command line compiler is available and provides straightforward support for compiling and running applications. <br><br><h3>What build tools support Kotlin?</h3>\n On the JVM side, the main build tools include Gradle, Maven, Ant, and Kobalt. There are also some build tools available that target client-side JavaScript. <br><br><h3>What does Kotlin compile down to?</h3>\nWhen targeting the JVM, Kotlin produces Java compatible bytecode. When targeting JavaScript, Kotlin transpiles to ES5.1 and generates code which is compatible with module systems including AMD and CommonJS. When targeting native, Kotlin will produce platform-specific code (via LLVM).",

The data of variable can be changed and reused depending on condition or on information passed to the program. <br><br><h3>Variable declaration</h3>\nKotlin uses two different keywords to declare variables: val and var. <br>- Use val for a variable whose value never changes. You can't reassign a value to a variable that was declared using val (Immutable variable). <br>- Use var for a variable whose value can change (Mutable variable).",

Some types can have a special internal representation - for example, numbers, characters and booleans can be represented as primitive values at runtime - but to the user they look like ordinary classes. In this section we describe the basic types used in Kotlin: numbers, booleans, characters, strings, and arrays.",

In programming, function is used to break the code into smaller modules which makes the program more manageable. <br>In Kotlin, there are two types of function: <br>- Standard library function <br>- User defined function. <br><br><h2>Kotlin standard library function</h2>\nIn Kotlin, there are different number of built-in functions already defined in standard library and available for use. We can call them by passing arguments according to requirement. Some standard library function includes: sqrt(), print(), rem(), toInt(), readline(), compareTo(), etc. <br><br><h2>Kotlin user-defined function</h2>\nA function which is defined by the user is called user-defined function. As we know, to divide a large program in small modules we need to define function. Each defined function has its own properties like name of function, return type of a function, number of parameters passed to the function etc.",

A certain block of code needs to be executed when some condition is fulfilled. The argument of when expression compares with all the branches one by one until some match is found. After the first match found, it reaches to end of the when block and execute the code next to when block. Unlike switch case in java or any other programming language, we do not require break statement at the end of each case.",

For example, if we want to print the number from 1 to 10, instead of writing a print statement 10 times, we can implement it through loops. <br>Loops reduce the number of lines in the program and improve reliability. Loops are control flow structures that controls the flow of the program within loops. <br>There are three types of loops in kotlin, for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.",
